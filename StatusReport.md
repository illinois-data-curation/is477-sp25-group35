Our project goal has stayed the same. It is to determine the correlation between social media posts on reddit and stock market performance. Using two data sets from reddit and yahoo finance our plan is to analyze how reddit posts about stock market movement affect performance.

Next, we will go through each task from our timeline that we have completed. First, our Github repository is up and running and our project plan has been submitted. Next, we programmatically completed data acquisition using a Kaggle reddit post data set as Reddit has set new licensing restrictions on using API keys. However, we still used the same subreddits as planned to include r/stocks, r/investing, and r/wallstreetbets. We did use a Yahoo API called yfinance to pull the individual stock data from the time frame the Kaggle data set collected its data. In addition, we created a uniform schema for both the reddit and yahoo data. To continue, we cleaned the Reddit data by removing spam posts and filtered by our five companies we are focusing on to create a data set of just the useful data. Using yahoo finance, we pulled the needed data for Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and Amazon. We found a faster way to analyze each Reddit post. We originally planned to determine the preconceived notion of each post by hand but due to the high number of posts we changed our plan to programmatically complete this. We used a program called textblob that gives each post a value from -1 to 1 and a positive, negative, or neutral tag.

We have made significant progress on the technical and challenging sections of the project, but there are still many things that we have yet to finish or start. We need to build visualizations so that we can communicate our results in the correlation between Reddit and stock price movement. We plan to create graphs that compare the daily Reddit posts to the stock closing price. For this we will be using matplotlib and seaborn libraires to easily create our visualizations. To proceed, we will soon be creating a Snakemake workflow to automate the entire pipeline. Once this is complete our data will be reproducible which is a crucial step for a transparent and accurate analysis. For our final report we will explain in detail each section of the repository including all steps of our project.
