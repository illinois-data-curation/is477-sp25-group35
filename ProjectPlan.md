##Overview
The goal of this project is two determine the strength and correlation between social media posts and stock market performances. Utilizing top publicly listed companies we plan to analyze specific social media updates and the pattern of change in the market associated with them. In 2025, it is essential to understand that social media makes a big impact when it comes to what people spend their money on and that stands true for investors as well. There are countless forums and posts regarding what investors plan to invest in and what their strategy is behind their choices. One example that we will be utilizing in this project is Reddit. Reddit contains several forums and communities regarding investing and people’s views in the current market.
Throughout this project we plan to collect data from social media sources like Reddit and stock market sources like Yahoo Finance. We would like to develop code that takes data from both sources, clean the data, and conduct an analysis on the social media posts and how the stock/market moved that day. This would include placing filters on different subreddits to locate the posts we are looking for and narrowing our stock analysis down to have matching posts and stock data. After that, we can analyze the trends and see if there is enough evidence to conclude that social media effects stock performance.

##Research Question
